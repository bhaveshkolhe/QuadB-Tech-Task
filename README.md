# Blockchain Demo in Python

This is a simple implementation of a blockchain in Python. It demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain technology, including block creation, proof-of-work (mining), and tamper detection.

## Features
- **Genesis Block Creation**: Automatically creates the first block in the blockchain.
- **Proof-of-Work**: Implements mining to find a valid hash based on a difficulty level.
- **Tamper Detection**: Demonstrates how tampering with a block invalidates the blockchain.

## Setup and Execution Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
